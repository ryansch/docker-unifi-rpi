## Versions

⚠️  This project is transitioning to MongoDB 4.4. Direct upgrades are not possible! ⚠️

I've added a check in the entrypoint that will prevent the Network Application (controller) from starting if
the database files are from an older mongo and need to be upgraded. This will allow you to rollback to the container version you were using without issue. You can then schedule the upgrade when it's convenient.

Upgrade instructions are here: <https://github.com/ryansch/docker-unifi-rpi/issues/95>

Ubiquiti releases 'unstable', 'testing', and 'stable candidate' versions as part of its beta group release structure.  These releases are included here.  Only stable releases are tagged with their general version (ex: `5.6` for the `5.6.30` stable release) or with `latest`.

## Supported Architectures

| Architecture | Available | Tag |
| :----: | :----: | ---- |
| amd64 | ✅ | \<version tag\>-amd64 |
| arm64v8 | ✅ | \<version tag\>-arm64v8 |
| arm32v7 | ❌ | |

Note: arm32v7 is no longer supported due to a lack of upstream support for mongodb <= 3.6 for arm32/armhf

# Configuration

As of 7.5.x, this container image supports unifi's standard configuration utilities.

You can supply a system.properties file at `/var/lib/unifi/system.properies` (in the container) or set any of the following environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JVM_INIT_HEAP_SIZE | Initial Java heap size in MiB | None |
| JVM_MAX_HEAP_SIZE | Maximum Java heap size in MiB | 1024 |
| JAVA_ENTROPY_GATHER_DEVICE | Path to entropy gathering device | None |
| UNIFI_JVM_EXTRA_OPTS | Additional JVM options | $JAVA_OPTS |

Additionally, `-XX:+UseParallelGC` is used by default but can be changed with the unifi property `unifi.G1GC.enabled`.
